# JS Report Card - Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
JS Report Card is an open-source tool that analyzes JavaScript and TypeScript projects for code quality, maintainability, and best practices. Similar to Go Report Card, it provides automated code reviews and generates a comprehensive report with a letter grade. The tool is designed to be used via web interface, CLI, or as part of CI/CD pipelines.

## Core Principles
- Start with essential analyzers that match Go Report Card's feature set
- Maintain high test coverage
- Focus on performance and caching
- Provide clear, actionable feedback
- Keep the initial scope focused and manageable

## Roadmap

### v0.1.0 - Foundation
**Focus**: Core infrastructure and basic analysis engine
- ✅ Monorepo setup with Turborepo
- ✅ Basic project structure
- ✅ Core types and interfaces
- ✅ Project cloning/downloading system
- ✅ Simple plugin system for analyzers
- ✅ Basic caching mechanism
- ✅ Initial CI setup

### v0.2.0 - Essential Analyzers

- [ ] Complexity analyzer (equivalent to `gocyclo`)
  - Cyclomatic complexity checking
  - Function length analysis
- [ ] Dead code detection (equivalent to `ineffassign`)
  - Unused variables
  - Unreachable code
- [ ] Basic test coverage reporting

### v0.3.0 - CLI Tool
**Focus**: Command line interface
- [ ] Local project analysis
- [ ] Multiple output formats (JSON, text, HTML)

- [ ] Basic error handling and reporting

### v0.4.0 - Web API
**Focus**: RESTful API service
- [ ] Project submission endpoint
- [ ] Analysis status endpoint
- [ ] Results retrieval endpoint
- [ ] Basic rate limiting
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Simple authentication system
- [ ] API documentation

### v0.5.0 - Web Interface
**Focus**: User interface and results display
- [ ] Project submission form

- [ ] Parallel analysis optimization

### v0.7.0 - CI Integration
**Focus**: CI/CD integration
- [ ] GitHub Actions integration
- [ ] GitLab CI integration
- [ ] PR comments functionality
- [ ] Status checks
- [ ] Badge integration
- [ ] Webhook support

### v1.0.0 - Production Ready
**Focus**: Production hardening
- [ ] Complete test coverage
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Enhanced error handling
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Security hardening

### v1.1.0 - Advanced Features
**Focus**: Additional capabilities
- [ ] Historical trend analysis
- [ ] Custom rule configurations
- [ ] Organization support
- [ ] Private repository support
- [ ] Enhanced security scanning
- [ ] API rate limiting improvements

## Initial MVP Analyzer Rules

### Style Checks (ESLint)
```typescript
const essentialRules = {
  'no-unused-vars': 'error',
  'no-undef': 'error',
  'no-multiple-empty-lines': 'warn',
  'indent': ['error', 2],
  'semi': ['error', 'always'],
  'quotes': ['error', 'single']
};
```

### TypeScript Checks
```typescript
const compilerOptions = {
  noImplicitAny: true,
  strictNullChecks: true,
  noUnusedLocals: true,
  noUnusedParameters: true
};
```

### Complexity Metrics
```typescript
const complexityRules = {
  maxCyclomaticComplexity: 15,
  maxFunctionLength: 50,
  maxFileLength: 300
};
```

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage
- [ ] Sub-5 minute analysis time for medium projects
- [ ] Less than 1% false positives
- [ ] Clear, actionable feedback for all issues
- [ ] Successful analysis of top 100 npm packages

## Future Considerations
- Framework-specific analyzers
- Custom rule creation
- Plugin marketplace
- Enterprise features
- Integration with code review platforms
- Performance analysis tools
